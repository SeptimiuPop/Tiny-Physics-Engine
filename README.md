# Physics Engine

A standalone application to exploring how different forces can affect an object. This project focuses on physics simulations / interpreting ecuations into code 

## Features

### Support needed

The software requirements to run must be the following :

- Linux OS 
- C++ 11 or above
- SFML library installed


## Setup work


### Install SFML

SFML can be installed dirrectly from the website by following the instructions or cloned from the [repository](https://github.com/SeptimiuPop/2D-Game-Engine/tree/main/External/SFML).

If the latter (cloning) is chosen, all directories except `include` and `lib` in the SFML folder can be removed. In order to compile the code properly the `build.sh` file should have the following changes :

```
g++ -c ../src/*.cpp -I <SFML/include Path>
g++ *.o -o main.exe -L <SFML/lib Path> -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system # to link.
```

Where `<SFML/include Path>` and `<SFML/lib Path>` are replaced by the path of the include and lib directories in the cloned SFML folder

### Prepare the commands

From the terminal use the following commands to give users permission to run the scripts. Replace File-name with the name of the shell script you want to give permission to :

```properties
sudo chmod u+x <file-name>
```  
Example :

```properties
sudo chmod u+x run.sh
```  
In order to successfully build and run the application you must create a folder named bin where the build files will go. To do this use the following command from the terminal :

```properties
mkdir bin
```

### Launch the Application

From the terminal use the following command to build and launch the application

`
./run.sh
`  

### Pushs changes to your repository

After forking the repository to your local machine and making some local changes, use the following command to add all changes, commit with a message and push to the remote repository 

`
./push.sh
`

Uppon using this command you will be prompted to write a commit message. To confirm and move to the next step press enter
